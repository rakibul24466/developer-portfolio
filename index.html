            <h3>Learning Web development from Programming Hero</h3>
            <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS
                and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
                The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the
                front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the
                field is developing. </p>
